**Chat. Voice. Tools. Approvals. Sessions. Themes.**

Your Hermes agent, in your pocket. Stream responses in real time. Talk out loud with Matrix-style voice mode. Approve tool executions. Switch models on the fly. All from your iPhone.

**Self-hosted. Your agent, your machine, your rules.** You run the Hermes Agent gateway on your own hardware — a Mac, a Linux box, a $5 VPS, or serverless infrastructure. Hermes Companion connects to it over an encrypted Tailscale tunnel. No cloud dependency. No middleman. Your data stays on your machines.

**Multiple servers. One app.** Connect to as many Hermes gateways as you want — your personal agent at home, your work agent at the office, a shared team server, a dedicated coding agent on a GPU box. Switch between them in Settings with a single tap. Each server keeps its own sessions, models, skills, and preferences.

Built by [Chibitek Labs](https://chibitek.com) on the [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) platform by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).

## Hermes Talk

The standout feature. Tap the waveform icon and your phone becomes a full-screen voice conversation terminal.

- **Matrix digital rain** background that responds to conversation state (fast rain while listening, slow glow while thinking, medium while speaking)
- **CRT scanlines and phosphor glow** for that terminal aesthetic
- **Center-orb audio visualizer** with real-time glow pulse
- **Glitch text animations** on the VOICE_MODE indicator
- **4 voice presets**: Matrix (green), Retro Amber, Neon, Blue Hacker
- **On-device transcription** via SFSpeechRecognizer — your speech never leaves the phone until you send it
- **TTS playback** with configurable voice, speed, and pitch
- Screen stays awake during conversations

```

**You own both ends.** The iPhone app is a thin client — it streams responses, displays tool events, and sends your messages. The Hermes Agent gateway on your machine does all the work: calling LLMs, running tools, managing memory, scheduling cron jobs. The connection between them is an encrypted Tailscale tunnel. No data passes through any third-party cloud. Connect to one server or ten — switch between them instantly in Settings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A running [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) gateway — on your own machine, a VPS, or serverless infrastructure. This is self-hosted: you run the agent on your own box.
- iOS 26.0+ device or simulator
- Xcode 26+ with iOS 26 SDK
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) installed on both your iPhone and the machine running your Hermes gateway
- An API key from any LLM provider (Nous Portal, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, or your own local model via Ollama)

### Why Tailscale?

Your Hermes gateway runs on a private network — your Mac, a home server, or a VPS. It has no public IP and no open ports. Tailscale creates an encrypted WireGuard tunnel between your iPhone and your gateway so the app can reach it securely from anywhere.

No port forwarding. No DDNS. No exposing your machine to the internet. Tailscale handles it.

1. Install [Tailscale](https://apps.apple.com/app/tailscale/id1470492403) from the App Store on your iPhone.
2. Install Tailscale on the machine running your Hermes gateway (`curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh` on Linux/macOS).
3. Sign in to both with the same account.
4. Your gateway is now reachable at your machine's Tailscale IP (e.g., `http://localhost:8642`).

The app handles Tailscale reconnection automatically — if the tunnel drops during a quick app switch, it retries in the background without kicking you to the login screen.

### Install

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chibitek/HermesCompanion.git
cd HermesCompanion
```

2. Generate the Xcode project:
```bash
xcodegen generate
```

3. Build and install on your device:
```bash
xcrun xcodebuild -project HermesCompanion.xcodeproj -scheme HermesCompanion \
  -configuration Debug -sdk iphoneos \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=$(CHIBITEK_TEAM_ID) CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development" \
  ARCHS=arm64 ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES -allowProvisioningUpdates build
```

4. Make sure Tailscale is connected on both devices.

5. Launch the app and enter your Hermes gateway URL (your machine's Tailscale IP and port) and API key.

6. Start chatting. Tap the waveform icon for Hermes Talk.

## Privacy and Security

Hermes Companion is self-hosted and privacy-first:

- **No cloud dependency.** The app connects directly to your Hermes gateway over an encrypted Tailscale WireGuard tunnel. No data passes through any third-party server.
- **Credentials in Keychain.** Your gateway URL and API key are stored in the iOS Keychain — not in plaintext, not in UserDefaults, not synced to iCloud.
- **On-device voice transcription.** Speech-to-text runs locally via Apple's SFSpeechRecognizer. Your voice audio never leaves the phone until you choose to send the transcription.
- **No analytics.** No telemetry, no tracking, no crash reporting to third parties. The app does not phone home.
- **Tool approvals.** Every tool execution requires your explicit approval before it runs. You see exactly what your agent is about to do.
- **Open source.** The entire app is MIT-licensed and auditable. No hidden binaries, no proprietary SDKs.

## FAQ

**Do I need a Hermes Agent gateway to use this app?**

Yes. Hermes Companion is a client — it connects to a [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) gateway that you run on your own machine. The gateway handles LLM calls, tool execution, memory, and session management.

**Can I use this without Tailscale?**

Technically yes — if your gateway is on a public IP or you use port forwarding. But that's insecure and not recommended. Tailscale gives you encrypted, zero-config networking for free. Install it, sign in, and you're done.

**Which models are supported?**

Any model your Hermes gateway supports. That includes Nous Portal (300+ models), OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models via Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Switch models mid-conversation with a single tap.

**Does voice mode send my audio to a server?**

No. Voice transcription runs on-device via Apple's SFSpeechRecognizer. The transcribed text is sent to your Hermes gateway only after you speak it — the same as if you had typed it.

**Can I use multiple Hermes servers?**

Yes. This is a core feature, not an afterthought. Connect to as many Hermes gateways as you want — a personal agent at home, a work agent at the office, a shared team server, or a dedicated coding agent on a GPU box. Each server is saved independently with its own URL, API key, label, sessions, models, skills, and preferences. Switch between them from Settings with a single tap. No re-login, no reconfiguration.

**Is this an official Nous Research product?**

No. Hermes Companion is built by [Chibitek Labs](https://chibitek.com) as a third-party iOS client for the Hermes Agent platform. Hermes Agent is built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).

**What's the difference between the app and the terminal?**

Nothing, functionally. The app is a different front-end for the same Hermes Agent gateway. Conversations, sessions, memory, and skills are shared across all surfaces — the iOS app, the terminal TUI, Telegram, Discord, and Slack. Pick up a conversation on your phone that you started on your Mac.
