## Hermes Talk

The standout feature. Tap the waveform icon and your phone becomes a full-screen voice conversation terminal.

- **Matrix digital rain** background that responds to conversation state (fast rain while listening, slow glow while thinking, medium while speaking)
- **CRT scanlines and phosphor glow** for that terminal aesthetic
- **Center-orb audio visualizer** with real-time glow pulse
- **Glitch text animations** on the VOICE_MODE indicator
- **4 voice presets**: Matrix (green), Retro Amber, Neon, Blue Hacker
- **On-device transcription** via SFSpeechRecognizer — your speech never leaves the phone until you send it
- **TTS playback** with configurable voice, speed, and pitch
- Screen stays awake during conversations

## Screenshots

### Chat

Real-time streaming chat with full tool execution visibility. Watch your agent think, call tools, and stream responses. Approve commands before they run. Send photos and files. All in real time.


### Sessions

Full conversation history with session types (cron, TUI, API), message counts, and durations. Search, rename, fork, and switch between sessions. Foreground sync pulls in replies from other Hermes surfaces (macOS, Telegram, Discord) automatically.


### Settings

Server connection, provider and model selection, skills browser, toolsets, voice configuration, appearance, and version info. All in clean glass-card sections.


### Provider and Model Selector

Switch between any provider your Hermes gateway supports — Nous, OpenRouter, Ollama, Huggingface, OpenAI, and more. Models sync automatically from your server. Pick from 300+ models with a single tap.


### Themes

Six built-in themes. Each one transforms the entire app — chat bubbles, input bar, settings, and voice page.

| Theme | Style |
| --- | --- |
| **Hermes** | Liquid Glass. Frosted, translucent, default. |
| **Matrix** | Terminal green on black. Monospace. Scanlines. CRT glow. |
| **Retro Amber** | CRT amber phosphor. Scanlines. Glow. |
| **Neon** | Electric magenta + cyan. Scanlines. |
| **Blue Hacker** | ICE blue terminal. Phosphor glow. |
| **Cyberpunk** | Dark glass with neon cyan and magenta accents. |
